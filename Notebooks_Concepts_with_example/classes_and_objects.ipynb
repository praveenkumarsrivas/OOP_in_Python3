    "### 1. Modularity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: OOP allows breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable components.\n",
    "- **Example**: In a machine learning project, you can separate data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation into different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reusability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Once a class is written, it can be reused across different projects.\n",
    "- **Example**: A `DataLoader` class can be reused for different datasets in various ML projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Maintainability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: OOP makes it easier to maintain and update code.\n",
    "- **Example**: Updating a method in a class automatically updates the behavior across all instances where the class is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: OOP supports the creation of scalable applications.\n",
    "- **Example**: As projects grow, new classes and objects can be added without affecting existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: OOP allows for creating complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and showing only the relevant parts.\n",
    "- **Example**: A `Model` class might hide the details of various machine learning algorithms and provide a simple interface for training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Encapsulation helps in bundling the data with the methods that operate on the data.\n",
    "- **Example**: In a `NeuralNetwork` class, the weights and biases are encapsulated within the class, ensuring controlled access and modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Inheritance allows new classes to adopt the properties and behaviors of existing classes.\n",
    "- **Example**: A `ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork` class can inherit from a `NeuralNetwork` class, extending its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.\n",
    "- **Example**: A `train` method might behave differently when called on a `LinearRegression` class compared to a `RandomForest` class."
